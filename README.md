# Motivational note:

What appeals to me about this project is that I will be dealing with different kinds of problems than with
regular, more user-facing web development. This offers me an opportunity to learn and grow in a new direction.
Dealing with a large number of asynchronous events, and keeping that complexity as simple as possible, has
always appealed to me. I'm not sure if this project will also involve developing front-end tools for data
analysts, but making large amounts of complex data easily accessible is also something that interests me.

I also look forward to eveloping, maintaining and improving a library for other developers to use.
